### A Proper Mongoose Based Database Client

#### Why?

We wanted to build a database client that:

- Has a table view to give us a holistic view of any given collection
- Has options to filter, sort, select, and populate data when viewing a collection
- Leverage mongoose schemas, validation, hooks, middleware
- Has easy navigation based on mongoose field references to other collections
- Integrated well with our workflow
- Is nice to use
- Is free and open source

#### TODO

- Styling!
- Add tests
- Add examples
- Nicer formatting of populated fields
- And lots more
